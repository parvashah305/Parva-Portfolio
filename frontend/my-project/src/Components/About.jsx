            A Bit About Me <br />
            <br />
            I began my programming journey three years ago with Python, aiming
            to develop graphical user interface applications using various
            Python libraries. What started as a hobby quickly became a passion,
            providing me with a profound sense of fulfillment and satisfaction.
            As I delved deeper into the world of programming, I expanded my
            horizons to web development, learning new languages and libraries
            such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React JS. I have always aspired
            to become a full-stack developer and have worked diligently to learn
            the necessary technologies, including ReactJS, NodeJS, MongoDB, and
            ExpressJS. <br />
            <br />
            As a second-year Computer Science student at PES University, I am
            eager to explore my passions further and enhance my skills in the
            tech industry. Being a self-taught programmer, I have honed my
            coding abilities through various projects and challenges. Presently,
            I am working as a FullStack Developer Intern at Comono India. <br />
            <br />
            When Iâ€™m not coding, you can find me playing cricket or listening to
            music. With my passion for technology and diverse skill set, I am
            confident in my ability to add value to any project or team I am
            part of. I am excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals
            and contribute to the advancement of the tech industry.
